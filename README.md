# Web-Engineering-Project
Final project for Web Engineering course

### Running the code
The API folder contains our node API. To use node to run it, install npm and node on your computer, then run 
`npm install` 
inside the API folder, followed by 
`node server.js` 
. After this, the server will wait for requests on localhost:8080.

### Choice of technologies
We picked the node framework combined with express and a mongodb database, because two of us had worked with them before. In this particular project, we had to work with json which is easy to do with each of these. There are also many node libraries that can easily be added using npm.

### Extensions
Due to a lack of time, no extensions to the API have been implemented yet.
